Demo Link:

Idea: An applicaton where users can create post featured the people they meet in Berkeley and their stories. The post can be modified and deleted. Other users can like the post, comment, and share. (The comment and share features are not implemented yet. We would like to continue work on it by using Facebook or Tumblr API.) Each user has a profile where they can see the posts they created.

Models and Description:
User: name, email, posts, avatar, bio, etc.
Post: title, image, description
Comment: text, user

Features:
Users can sign up and login, post on the front page, add description and image to their post, like other user's post, post comment, update profile. (Hopefully we can separate the users from admins in the future, so only admins can post on the front page)

Division of Labor:
Victoria: made Post, related controllers, views, all stylings
Sean: made User, related controllers, views,  debug
